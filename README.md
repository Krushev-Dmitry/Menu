# Menu
 The app is designed to train my programming skills. I tried to replicate the interface and functionality of a well-known pizza ordering app.
This application uses design elements such as:
- Collection View
- Table View
- Scroll View
- Segment Control
- Custom Allert
- Costom cells
- Custom slide menu
And skills such as: 
- reading and writing to the database (use FireBase)
- user authorization
